	<div class="desc">
		<p>An upcoming Full-Stack Developer. For someone who was never fond of coding, I never thought I'd describe myself as an upcoming Full-Stack Developer. I have completed my Engineering in Computer Science at RNS Institute of Engineering and currently pursuing Full Stack Development Career Path at Edwisor.</p>
		<p>I am also a Freelance Musician. I have always had an inclination towards music. Although, I started  as a classical pianist, I have grown increasingly interested in Synth and Indie Rock Music. I also consider myself as an audiophile. Yes, overly enthusiastic about audio technologies. </p>

<h3>Virtual Reality</h3><img src="https://creato.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IUYGUTYFgo.png" class="tech">

<p>Virtual reality (VR) is an interactive computer-generated experience taking place within a simulated environment, that incorporates mainly auditory and visual, but also other types of sensory feedback like haptic. This immersive environment can be similar to the real world or it can be fantastical, creating an experience that is not possible in ordinary physical reality. <br> To Learn more, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">click here</a>.</p>

	<h2>Project(s)</h2>
	<h3>Tag Based Image Search By Social Re-Ranking</h3>
<ul>
<li>This paper proposes a tag-based image search approach with social re-ranking. We systematically fuse the visual information, social user’s information and image view times to boost the diversity performance of the search result. The proposed inter-user re-ranking method and intra-user re-ranking method achieves a good trade-off between the diversity and relevance performance. </li>
<li>These methods not only reserve the relevant images, but also effectively eliminate the similar images from the same user in the ranked results. In the intra-user re-ranking process, fuse the visual, semantic and views information into a regularization framework to learn the relevance score of every image in each user’s image set. </li>
<li>To speed up the learning speed, use the co-occurrence word set of the given query to estimate the semantic relevance matrix.</li>
